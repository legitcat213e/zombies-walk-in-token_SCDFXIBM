it is a project to trace the entry and exit of people at different places or stores using RFID technology!
And it can detect if you are close to a group of people and vibrate a unique vibration as a warning.
using RFID technology it is able to detect the token despite not being in line of sight.
how does it work?

So basically RFID scanner will send radio frequency to interact with the token and it will send the ID of the token
and check if the ID is in the list if it is do safeentry. If check her phone or token for safeentry.
and there is a proximity sensor to sense if anyone is close by and in close contact.
if in very close contact the token will do a unique vibration to warn the user.
